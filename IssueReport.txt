how to refresh the netflow table on dataplane? 
    By remove old flow?

how to calculate A_flow_bytes_per_second_src_to_dst_register?
    average(total bytes/ flow duration) or instantaneous(current flow bytes/(current timestamp-last timestamp)) speed?
    current division cannot support big quotient, need further research

how to define flow_duration? just src->dst direction, or both src<->dst

how to transfer unit of timestamp?
